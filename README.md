# WaterQuality_Analysis
## Objective 

The goal of the project is to predict water quality indices or classifications based on the provided dataset. This can help in identifying water bodies at risk of contamination or unsuitable for specific uses. Such predictions are crucial for environmental protection, public health, and resource management.

## Dataset

The dataset contains measurements from multiple water bodies and includes features like pH value, hardness, turbidity, nitrate levels, and other indicators of water quality. Some datasets may also include Water Quality Index (WQI) values or classifications (e.g., potable vs. non-potable). Data preprocessing techniques like normalization or handling missing values are applied to prepare the data for modeling
